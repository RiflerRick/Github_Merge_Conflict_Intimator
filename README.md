### Github Merge Conflict Intimator

- **Requirement:** Our requirement was that we had to intimate commit authors of conflicting 
commits in merge conflicts. Imagine there are jenkins jobs configured to actually merge branches to
 keep 2 branches up to date. Now if the jenkins jobs could be configured in such a way that we
  simply have to click a swicth and that would send emails to corresponding commit authors who are
   **culprits** of the merge conflict
